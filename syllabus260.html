         <h3>The Big Picture</h3>
      
	  <h4>Course Goals</h4>
      <p>Chem 260 provides an introduction to core concepts in physical chemistry and in analytical chemistry. Because these areas, even at an introductory level, are too broad to cover in a single semester, our <b><em>content-specific goals</em></b> are relatively modest; they are to...</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>predict the favorability of a chemical reaction and how that favorability depends on temperature</li>
        <li>determine the composition of a chemical system at equilibrium </li>
        <li>evaluate how a reaction progresses and elucidate possible pathways by which it might occur</li>
        <li>study a reaction quantitatively in the laboratory by designing and carrying out experiments, and by evaluating experimental data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to these content-specific goals, we also have several <b><em>growth-oriented goals</em></b> that are important to your development as a student in STEM; these are to...</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>learn to identify patterns in data and to ask interesting questions</li>
        <li>appreciate the utility of mathematical models as predictive tools</li>
        <li>increase your ability to think critically about abstract ideas</li>
        <li>improve your skills at solving quantitative problems</li>
        <li>become more comfortable working in the laboratory as part of a research team and to communicate better the results of your work in lab</li>
      </ul>
        
        <h4>Working Toward Success in Chem 260</h4>
      <p>Whatever your background in chemistry, specifically, and in STEM, more generally, in addition to your usual academic commitments&mdash;attending class and lab, completing assignments, and preparing for exams, to name a few items&mdash;commit yourself to...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><em>focusing on our growth-oriented goals as much as you focus on our content-specific goals:</em></b> identify the new skills you are developing and the existing skills you are strengthening</li>
        <li><b><em>participating in class and in lab:</em></b> take full advantage of our time together by being an active, engaged learner</li>
        <li><b><em>collaborating with your classmates in class and in lab:</em></b> education is not a competition; you have much to learn from each other and to teach each other</li>
        <li><b><em>reflecting every day, even if for just a few minutes, on your most recent class or lab:</em></b> look for connections between what you learn in class and what you do in lab; between a new topic and topics from earlier in the semester; or between this course and other courses you are taking or have completed</li>
        <li><b><em>asking questions:</em></b> in-class and out-of-class; of yourself, of me, and of each other; to clarify uncertainty or to satisfy curiosity</li>
      </ul>
        
        <h3>The Nitty-Gritty Details</h3>
      
      <h4>Textbook and Other Resources</h4>
      <p>The textbook for this course is Chemistry: Atoms First, a free textbook available from OpenStax. You may choose to access the textbook through a browser, but you may also download it as a pdf file, download it to a Kindle, or order a print version. Visit the <a href = https://openstax.org/details/books/chemistry-atoms-first>OpenStax website</a> to explore your options.</p> 
        
      <p>The class schedule provides daily reading assignments and suggested end-of-chapter problems, which provide practice in the basic calculations necessary for success in this course. You should use these end-of-chapter problems to test your facility with these calculations; answers to these problems are included at the end of the textbook. We will spend much of our time in class working on more comprehensive and more integrative problems that build on these basic calculations and that better reflect typical exam questions.</p>
        
      <p>No textbook is a perfect match for any course and you will find that our textbook explores some topics at a greater depth and explores other topics more superficially than will we. As needed, we will supplement the textbook with additional resources. Your textbook and these other resources will provide you with an additional perspective on the material we cover in class; exams and other assignments will draw only on the concepts we cover in class and not on additional concepts that appear only in the textbook or in other resources.</p>
        
      
      <h4>Q-Competency</h4>
      <p>This section of Chem 260 is designated as a <em>Q</em>-course. A signficant portion of our time in class and in lab is spent solving quantitative problems and using other forms of quantitative reasoning. A course grade of C or better is required to receive <em>Q</em>-certification.</p>
      
      <h4>Grades</h4>
      <p>Your final grade is determined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>three unit exams: 13% each for a total of 39%</li>
        <li>cumulative final exam: 26%</li>
        <li>take-home assignments and quizzes: 15%</li>
        <li>lab work: 20%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Letter grades are assigned using the following scale:</p>
      <table class="table table-condensed table-striped">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>A (≥93.0)</td>
        <td>A- (90.0-92.9)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>B+ (87.0-89.9)</td>
        <td>B (83.0-86.9)</td>
        <td>B- (80.0-82.9)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>C+ (77.0-79.9)</td>
        <td>C (73.0-76.9)</td>
        <td>C- (70.0-72.9)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>D+ (67.0-69.9)</td>
        <td>D (63.0-66.9)</td>
        <td>D- (60.0-62.9)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>F (<60.0)</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
    <p>Final averages are not rounded; to earn a grade of B instead of a grade of B-, for example, you need a final average of ≥83.0. These ranges are fixed with the following caveats:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>At the instructor's discretion, a grade on a borderline may be increased or be decreased by a maximum of one point to account for intangible factors. For example, a 79.7 (C+) may become an 80.7 (B-) or an 80.7 (B-) might become a 79.7 (C+). Intangible factors include, but are not limited to, a particularly strong or weak final exam, a steady improvement or decline in your performance during the term, or a particularly strong or weak contribution to the class or lab. These adjustments are not common.</li>
        <li>To pass the course, you must have either a combined average of 60% on the three regular exams or a score of at least 60% on the final exam, and you must complete all laboratory work.</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h4>Office Hours</h4>
      <p>Feel free to stop by my office (Julian 364) without an appointment at any of these times:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Monday from 10:30am - 12:00pm and from 2:00pm - 3:00pm</li>
        <li>Tuesday from 1:00pm - 3:00pm (in Julian 338)</li>
        <li>Wednesday from 9:30am - 11:00am and from 6:30pm - 8:30pm</li>
        <li>Thursday by appointment</li>
        <li>Friday from 9:30am - 11:00am and from 2:00pm - 4:00pm</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you wish to schedule an appointment at another time, please catch me after class or lab, send me an <a href="mailto:harvey@depauw.edu">email</a>, or drop by my office.</p>
        
        <h4>STEM Guide</h4>
      <p>This semester Mahmoud Abouelkheir will serve as our course's STEM Guide, providing an additional resource for topics we are covering in class and in lab. Mahmoud will be present during portions of our lab meetings and will hold office hours from 8-10pm on Sunday and Tuesday evenings in the Julian Auditorium (or an adjacent classroom). Mahmoud will be an important resource as you work on lab projects (indeed, at various times you will be required to work with Mahmoud as part of your experimental planning. Mahmoud can also serve as an important resource when you are working on lab reports, take-home assignments, and suggested problems.</p>
      
      <h4>Due Dates</h4>
      <p>Because I value thoughtful, well-written, and well-reasoned work more than absolute deadlines, the due dates for assignments allow for some flexiblity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Individual Assignments</em>: Unless otherwise specified, there is no penalty for turning in an individual assignment within 24 hours of its deadline. In addition, for up to <b>two</b> individual assigments you may request an additional extension of 48 hours (for a total extension of 72 hours); you must inform me that you are using one of your additional 48-hour extensions in advance of the assignment's original due date. Individual assignments include take-home assignments, and short reports and formal reports for the first three project-based labs. Additional delays in submitting assignments carry a loss of one point per 24 hours.</li>
            <li><em>Group Assignments</em>: Unless otherwise specified, there is no penalty for turning in the final product of a group assignment 48 hours after its deadline. Additional delays in submitting assignments carry a loss of one point per 24 hours. This does not apply to drafts, which must be turned in by the due date.</li>
        </ul>
          
      
      <h4>Attendance</h4>
      <p>A textbook is a poor substitute for the active learning that takes place in a classroom. Although attendance at class sessions is not required, I encourage you to take advantage of our time together by engaging fully with the material and with your classmates during class. If you miss class it is your responsibility to know and to understand the material covered that day; ask a classmate for a copy of his or her notes and visit the course website for copies of handouts.</p>
        
      <p>You are expected to attend all lab sessions, arriving on time and ready to work; <b><em>arriving late and unexcused absences will affect your final grade in lab</em></b>. If you need to miss lab for any reason (travel to athletic events, academic conflicts, illness, etc.), then we will find alternative times when you can make appropriate contributions to your group's lab work.</p>
        
         <h3>Selected DePauw University Academic Policies</h3>
      
      <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
      <p>Although you may make frequent use of external resources when completing an assignment, it is important that the work you submit represents your understanding of the assignment. A failure to do so is unethical and a serious breach of academic integrity. Be sure to review DePauw's guidelines for academic integrity, which are included in the Student Handbook; in particular, review the examples of plagiarism. Although often unintentional, plagiarism nevertheless is a serious violation and may result in a significant reduction in your grade for an assignment or for the course.</p>
        
      <p>Be sure to consult with me if you are unsure about any issue concerning academic integrity.</p>

      <h4>Disability Services</h4>
      <p>It is the policy and practice of DePauw University to provide reasonable accommodations for students with properly documented disabilities. Written notification from Student Disability Services is required. If you are eligible to receive an accommodation and would like to request it for this course, please contact Student Disability Services. Allow one week advance notice to ensure enough time for reasonable accommodations to be made. Otherwise, it is not guaranteed that the accommodation can be provided on a timely basis. Accommodations are not retroactive. Students who have questions about Student Disability Services or who have, or think they may have, a disability (psychiatric, attentional, learning, vision, hearing, physical, medical, etc.) are invited to contact Student Disability Services for a confidential discussion in Union Building Suite 200 or by phone at 658-6267.</p>
     
     <h4>Religious Accomodations</h4>
     <p>DePauw accommodates students who are adherents of a religious tradition and wish to fulfill obligations of that religious tradition on holy days. Students are expected to notify their instructors of their intent to fulfill the obligations of their religious tradition well in advance of these days. For the sake of this policy, “holy days” are defined as periods of time in which either activities required by normal class participation are prohibited by a religious tradition, or a special worship obligation is required by a religious tradition.</p>
