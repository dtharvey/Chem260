<p align="left">Chemistry 260,
   which is one of four courses comprising the department's introductory core, provides
   an introduction to physical and analytical chemistry. As its name implies,
   this course focuses on three  topics of central importance to understanding
 chemical reactivity: thermodynamics, equilibria, and kinetics.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Thermodynamics</strong> is the study of the energetics of chemical reactions. Experience shows
   us that many reactions are not reversible; for example, in a gas furnace
   the combustion of methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, in the presence of oxygen,
   O<sub>2</sub>, produces carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>,  water,
   H<sub>2</sub>O, and heat:</p>
 <p align="center">CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> â€”&gt; CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
 <p align="left">The reverse reaction, under  identical conditions,
   does not occur; that is, we do not expect the carbon dioxide we exhale to react with moisture in the air to produce methane and oxygen. Of particular interest to us is our ability to
   predict whether a  chemical reaction will occur under a given set of conditions.</p>
<p align="left">Once it begins, a  chemical reaction continues until the reactants and the products no longer change concentration.
   We call the reaction's end point a state of <strong>equilibrium</strong>. Of particular
   interest to us is our ability to predict the composition of a system
   at equilibrium and to predict how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in its conditions.</p>
<p align="left">Although thermodynamics
   allows us to predict a reaction's favorability, we cannot predict
   whether the reaction  happens in a reasonable amount of time. For example, thermodynamics tells us that a mixture
   of methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, and oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>,
   will react to make water. Mixtures of the two gases, however, are
   stable indefinitely unless we first add energy, perhaps in the form of a spark. The study of <strong>kinetics</strong> helps us understand the factors
   that influence how quickly a reaction occurs. The study of kinetics
   also allows us to explain how a chemical reaction proceeds on a microscopic
   level.</p>
