<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>Chem 260 provides an introduction to physical and analytical chemistry. Because these fields are too broad to cover in a single semester, our content-specific goals  are relatively modest; these are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>predict the favorability of chemical reactions</li>
  <li>characterize the extent to which a chemical reaction occurs</li>
  <li>determine the final composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium</li>
  <li>evaluate a reaction's temporal feasibility</li>
  <li>elucidate  possible pathways for a chemical reaction</li>
  <li>study reactions quantitatively in the laboratory</li>
  <li>design, carry out and evaluate experiments involving chemical reactivity</li>
  <li>appreciate the importance of physical and analytical chemistry in other disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these more content-specific goals, we have several broader goals; these are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>appreciate
    the utility of  models as predictive tools</li>
  <li> learn
    to think critically about  abstract ideas</li>
  <li> improve
    your skills at solving quantitative problems</li>
  <li> become
    comfortable  working in the laboratory</li>
  <li> learn to process and evaluate large amounts of information</li>
  <li>work with others as part of a research team</li>
</ul>
<h2>Textbook and Other Materials<br />
  </h2>
<p>The textbook for this course is <em>Chemistry: Atoms First</em> by Budge and Overby, which is available from the campus bookstore. This also is the  textbook for Chem 130. You may use either the first edition or the second edition. Chapter sections and suggested problems are provided for both texts on the <a href="Chem260ClassSchedule.html">class schedule</a> page. Some topics are not included in our textbook and, instead, are covered in supplementary on-line essays.</p>
<p>Additional supplementary materials, including copies of handouts, answer keys to worksheets, and practice exams, are available on the <a href="Chem260Archives.html">archives</a> page.<br />
</p>
<h2>Lab Assignments<br />
</h2>
<p>Chemistry is an experimental science; experience in lab, therefore, is essential to almost all chemistry courses. Our focus in this course is on learning how to investigate the thermodynamic, equilibrium, and kinetic properties of chemical reactions. To accomplish this you will learn  several routine quantitative methods of analysis and will learn to design experiments.<br />
</p>
<p>Working as part of a small research team of 2–3 students, you will complete four preliminary labs that introduce the software, the hardware, and the techniques  you will use in later experiments. Reports for these experiments will focus on developing your skills in presenting and discussing  data, in describing experiments, and in providing a context for your work. <br />
</p>
<p>After completing the preliminary labs, you will complete four open-ended project experiments. Each of these experiments begins with a description of the system under investigation, a statement of the project's goals, and a list of hints, suggestions, and/or questions to consider. The design of the experiment is left to you! </p>
<p>A schedule of labs and due dates for reports is available on the course's <a href="Chem260LabSchedule.html">lab</a> page</p>
<h2>Q Competency </h2>
<p>This section of Chemistry 260 is designated as a Q course. During the semester, both in class and in lab, we will often focus  on numerical problem solving and quantitative reasoning within the context of chemistry and biochemistry — as both are central aspects of Chemistry 260,  there will not be designated Q assignments. A course grade of C or better will earn the Q competency for Chemistry 260. <br />
</p>
<h2>Grades<br />
  </h2>
<p>Your final grade is determined using the following percentages:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>three regular exams: 15% each for a total of 45%</li>
  <li>cumulative final exam: 30%</li>
  <li>miscellaneous take-home assignments: 5%</li>
  <li>lab work: 20%</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades are assigned using the following scale:</p>
<blockquote>
  <table width="33%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="34%">&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="33%"><div align="center">A (&gt;92)</div></td>
      <td width="33%"><div align="center">A– (92–90)</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div align="center">B+ (89–87)</div></td>
      <td><div align="center">B (86–83)</div></td>
      <td><div align="center">B– (82–80)</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div align="center">C+ (79–77)</div></td>
      <td><div align="center">C (76–73)</div></td>
      <td><div align="center">C– (72–70)</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div align="center">D+ (69–67)</div></td>
      <td><div align="center">D (66–63)</div></td>
      <td><div align="center">D– (62–60)</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td><div align="center">F (&lt;60)</div></td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>Final averages are not rounded; to earn a grade of B instead of a grade of B–, for example, you need a final average ≥ 83.0. These ranges are fixed with the following caveats:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the instructor’s discretion, a grade on a borderline may by increased or decreased by a maximum of one point to account for intangible factors. For example, a 79.7 (C+) may become an 80.7 (B–) or an 83.7 (B) may become an 82.7 (B–). Intangible factors include, but are not limited to, a particularly strong or weak final exam, a steady improvement or decline in your performance during the term, or a particularly strong or weak contribution to the class or lab. These adjustments are not common.</li>
  <li>You must have a combined average of 60% on the three regular exams <strong>or</strong> a score of greater than 60% on the final exam to pass the course.</li>
  <li>You must complete all laboratory work to pass the course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Office Hours<br />
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monday: 9:00 am – 10:00 am</li>
  <li>Tuesday: 10:00 am – 12:00 pm (noon)</li>
  <li>Wednesday: 1:30 pm – 2:30 pm</li>
  <li>Thursday: 1:00 pm – 3:00 pm</li>
  <li>Friday: 9:00 am – 10:00 am</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to  schedule an appointment at another time, please  catch me after class or lab, send me an email (<a href="mailto:harvey@depauw.edu">harvey@depauw.edu</a>), or drop by my office.<br />
</p>
<h2>Due Dates for  Assignments<br />
</h2>
<p>Because I value thoughtful, well-written work more than absolute deadlines,  due dates for most assignments are intentionally flexible. Unless otherwise specified, there is no penalty for turning assignments in late <u>if I am still in the process of grading the assignment</u>; however, once I finish grading a set of assignments, any missing work receives a grade of 0 (zero) — no exceptions.<br />
</p>
<p>Flexibility in due dates is not a license to procrastinate and abuse of this policy will result in your loss of this privilege. <u>To take advantage of this policy you must consult with me before the assignment’s due date and you must show evidence of having made significant progress.</u><br />
</p>
<h2>Attendance in Class and Lab<br />
</h2>
<p>A textbook is a poor substitute for the active learning that takes place in the classroom. Although attendance for class sessions is not required, I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to fully engage yourself with the material and with your classmates during class. Whether you miss class for a legitimate reason or simply need a day off, it is your responsibility to know and understand the material covered that day. Ask a classmate for a copy of his or her notes, drop by my office, or visit the course’s web-site. We will not take class time to review material for students who miss class.<br />
</p>
<p>Attendance at all lab sessions is required; missing lab sessions will result in a reduction in your lab grade and may result in your failing the course. You should not assume that lab work can be made up at alternate times.<br />
</p>
<h2>Academic Integrity<br />
</h2>
<p>Although you may make frequent use of external resources (e.g. the internet, the library, other students) when completing assignments, it is important that the work you submit represents your understanding of the assignment. Failure to do so is unethical and a serious breach of academic integrity. Be sure to review DePauw's guidelines for academic integrity, which are included in the Student Handbook; in particular, review the examples of plagiarism. Although often unintentional, plagiarism is nevertheless a serious violation and can result in a significant reduction in your grade for an assignment or for the course. <br />
</p>
<p>A potential problem with group work occurs when you collect data as a group but are responsible for preparing an individual analysis of that data. When you are asked to work individually, it is not acceptable to share calculations, spreadsheets, or figures. Although you may discuss how to analyze your data, the work you turn in must represent you analysis of the data and your interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>Be sure to consult with me if you are unsure about any issue concerning academic integrity.</p>
<h2>Disability Services</h2>
<p>DePauw University is committed to providing equal access to academic programs and university administered activities with reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities, in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act and Amendments (ADAAA).  Any student who feels she or he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability or learning challenge is strongly encouraged to contact Pamela Roberts, Director of Student Disability Services and ADA Compliance for further information on how to receive accommodations and support.  Contact information for Student Disability Services is: 408 S. Locust Street, Suite 200, in The Memorial Student Union Building (765-658-6267).  It is the responsibility of the student to share the letter of accommodation with faculty and staff members. Accommodations will not be implemented until the faculty or staff member has received the official letter. Accommodations are not retroactive.   It is the responsibility of the student to discuss implementation of accommodations with each faculty and staff member receiving the letter.</p>
